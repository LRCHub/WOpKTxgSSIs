```
I really wanna stop
But I just gotta taste for it
I feel like I could fly
with the boy on the moon
So honey hold my hand
You like making me wait for it?
I feel I could die
walking up to the room,
Oh yeah
Late night watching television
But how'd we get
in this position?
It's way too soon
I know it isn't love
But I need to tell you something
I really really really really
really really like you
And I want you
Do you want me?
Do you want me too?
I really really really really
really really
Like you
And I want you
Do you want me?
Do you want me too?
Oh did I say too much?
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch
I really really really really
really really like you
And I want you
Do you want me
Do you want me too?
It's like everything you say is
a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is
get into your head
We could stay alone
You and me, and this temptation
Sipping on your lips
Hanging on by a thread
Late night watching television
But how'd we get
in this position?
It's way too soon
I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something
I really really really really
really really like you
And I want you
Do you want me
Do you want me too?
I really really really really
really really
Like you
And I want you
Do you want me
Do you want me too?
Oh did I say too much?
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch
I really really really really
really really like you
And I want you
Do you want me
Do you want me too?
Who gave you eyes like that?
Said you could keep them
I don't know how to act
Or if I should be leaving
I'm running out of time
Going out of my mind
But I need to tell you something
Yeah I need to
tell you something...
I really really really really
really really like you
And I want you
Do you want me
Do you want me too?
I really really really really
really really
Like you
And I want you
Do you want me
Do you want me too?
Oh did I say too much?
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch
I really really really really
really really like you
And I want you
Do you want me
Do you want me too?
I really really really really
really really like you
And I want you
Do you want me
Do you want me too?
I really really really really
really really
Like you
And I want you
Do you want me
Do you want me too?
